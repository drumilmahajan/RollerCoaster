def rollercoaster(a):
    '''
    This function takes in an array and convert it into a
    roller coaster array.  An array B[1 . . . n]is called a roller coaster if 
    B[1] < B[2], B[2] > B[3], B[3] < B[4]
    and so on. More formally: B[2i] > B[2i + 1] and B[2i âˆ’ 1] < B[2i] for all i.
    
    The pseudo code for the solution is given below.

        for i in range(1, n-1):
            # Here we access the next element a[i+1] thats why the range is from 1 to n-1,
            # so that we dont go array out of bounds. 
            if i%2 == 1:
                if a[i] > a[i+1]:
